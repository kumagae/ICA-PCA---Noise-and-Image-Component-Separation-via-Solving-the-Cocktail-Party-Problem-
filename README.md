ICA&amp;PCA - Noise and Image Component Separation via Solving the Cocktail Party Problem 

"Independent component analysis was originally developed to deal with problems that are closely related to the cocktail-party problem. The goal is to find a linear representation of nongaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation." More details on ICA can be found in https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/papers/NN00new.pdf

In this notebook, we take the mixed sounds and images, and apply ICA tn them to separate the sources.
